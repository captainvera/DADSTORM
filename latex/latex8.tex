\SubSection{Semantics algorithm}

One of the biggest concern in the distributed tuple processing is being
able to a guarantee a certain semantics associated with the processing of
a tuple in the presence of system failures, and inevitably the way in
needs to reconfigure in order to continue functioning properly. This issue
is inevitably linked to the way that the system does fault tolerance. The
algorithm used for at least once and exactly once is very simmilar, as
well as using the same data structures and most of the same procedures,
but the differences will be explained below. In the follow subsections we
explain how the system assures that a tuple is processed at most once, at
least once and exactly once.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\subsubsection{At-Most-Once}

To assure that a tuple is processed at most once, a system must only send
any tuple once, indepent of failure. Since a configuration for this system
is dependent on being an ?acyclic? graph, the only guarantee we need to
provide is that there isn't any kind of mechanism to resend tuples in case
of a takeover of a node that crashed by another node.  As such the
implementation of this strategy relies on not sharing any kind of
information about tuples already processed, and not doing anything upon
the takeover. This way, a certain tuple from an input is only sent once in
the forward direction of the distributed network, and in case of a node
failing all the tuples that it had processed but not sent yet won't be
processed at all.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\subsubsection{At-Least-Once}

(????????????????????Maybe should be in a upper section) If the system
must process a certain tuple at least once then there must a guarantee
that in any kind of a node failure the tuples that weren't successfuly
sent to a node in failure are sent either to another node or to the the
original node if it recovers. There are however other scenarios in which a
node can fail, for example after receiving a tuple but before sending it
to the next operator if there is any. Keeping in mind that the system must
obviously be ashynchronous in this confirmation, then the previous node
can't easily know it has to resend the tuple, and when it doesn't, or how
long it needs to keep the tuple.  In this approach the tuples would need
to be kept in every operator at least until the tuple was processed by
every node, presenting scalability issues.  (DATA STRUCTURES) To understand how the
algorithm works we must first explain the used data structures: A tuple is
identified by it's Tuple Id structure which represents a stream of a tuple
along the processing chain. In each specific tuple there is an unique id
that is usualy kept along all operators, unless there must an output of
several tuples from the same one, efectively divering the tuple stream.
The remaining information kept in the Tuple Id refers to the operator and
replica it came from. In each node there is a delivery table (a simple
Hash-based Map that stores each tuple by its unique id) and that keeps
every tuple received in a replica until it can be disposed.  There is
aswell a shared tuple table in each node that stores Tuple Records
associated to a tuple id (in a simillar Hash Map). A tuple record is a
small representation of a tuple containing its Tuple Id, as well as the
replica emiting the tuple record. This way the tuple record contains only
the necessary information for a node to re-process a tuple that wasn't
properly processed due to failure. For information storing purposes the
tuple records can have a state (pending or purged) that is used to store
tuple records of the tuples processed by a replica in a purged state
instead of deleting them. (ALGORITHM): When a node receives a tuple the first
thing it must do is insert it into the delivery table and its shared tuple
record table.  The node then synchronizes every table with other replicas
shared tables and finnaly places the tuple in the output buffer. After the
tuple is sent and confirmation is received the node will first issue the
deletion of the tuple record of every other shared table and purge its own
shared table of the same tuple. Finally it will warn the replica which the
tuple originated from that it can finally delete it from its delivery table
since it was already received by the forward node. Finnaly this information is
used whenever a node takes over another failling node. It scans its shared
table looking for tuple records of the dead node and for each record it
requests the tuple to the replica it originated from.  Finnaly the tuple is
processed and sent to the following node, by the same procedures explained
before, as if a new tuple was received. Note that this approach only
ensures the semantics of the delivery in case of a single horizontal
failure (when two sequential replicas on the path of processing a tuple
fail) It could also support more failures if necessary by extending the
number of nodes where a tuple is kept before it is delivered.

\Section{Style Guidelines}

Please follow the steps outlined below when submitting your manuscript to
the IEEE Computer Society Press. Note there have been some changes to the
measurements from previous instructions. 

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Margins and page numbering}

All printed material, including text, illustrations, and charts, must be
kept within a print area 6-7/8 inches (17.5 cm) wide by 8-7/8 inches
(22.54 cm) high.  Do not write or print anything outside the print area.
Number your pages lightly, in pencil, on the upper right-hand corners of
the BACKS of the pages (for example, 1/10, 2/10, or 1 of 10, 2 of 10, and
so forth). Please do not write on the fronts of the pages, nor on the
lower halves of the backs of the pages.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
\SubSection{Formatting your paper}

All text must be in a two-column format. The total allowable width of the
text area is 6-7/8 inches (17.5 cm) wide by 8-7/8 inches (22.54 cm) high.
Columns are to be 3-1/4 inches (8.25 cm) wide, with a 5/16 inch (0.8 cm)
space between them.  The main title (on the first page) should begin 1.0
inch (2.54 cm) from the top edge of the page. The second and following
pages should begin 1.0 inch (2.54 cm) from the top edge. On all pages, the
bottom margin should be 1-1/8 inches (2.86 cm) from the bottom edge of the
page for $8.5 \times 11$-inch paper; for A4 paper, approximately 1-5/8
inches (4.13 cm) from the bottom edge of the page.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Type-style and fonts}

Wherever Times is specified, Times Roman may also be used.  If neither is
available on your word processor, please use the font closest in
appearance to Times that you have access to.

MAIN TITLE. Center the title 1-3/8 inches (3.49 cm) from the top edge of
the first page. The title should be in Times 14-point, boldface type.
Capitalize the first letter of nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and
adverbs; do not capitalize articles, coordinate conjunctions, or
prepositions (unless the title begins with such a word).  Leave two blank
lines after the title.

AUTHOR NAME(s) and AFFILIATION(s) are to be centered beneath the title and
printed in Times 12-point, non-boldface type.  This information is to be
followed by two blank lines.

The ABSTRACT and MAIN TEXT are to be in a two-column format. 

MAIN TEXT. Type main text in 10-point Times, single-spaced.  Do NOT use
double-spacing. All paragraphs should be indented 1 pica (approx. 1/6 inch
or 0.422 cm). Make sure your text is fully justified---that is, flush left
and flush right.  Please do not place any additional blank lines between
paragraphs.  Figure and table captions should be 10-point Helvetica
boldface type as in \begin{figure}[h] \caption{Example of caption.}
\end{figure}

\noindent Long captions should be set as in \begin{figure}[h]
	\caption{Example of long caption requiring more than one line. It is not
	typed centered but aligned on both sides and indented with an additional
margin on both sides of 1~pica.} \end{figure}

\noindent Callouts should be 9-point Helvetica, non-boldface type.
Initially capitalize only the first word of section titles and first-,
second-, and third-order headings.

FIRST-ORDER HEADINGS. (For example, {\large \bf 1.  Introduction}) should
be Times 12-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left, with one
blank line before, and one blank line after.

SECOND-ORDER HEADINGS. (For example, {\elvbf 1.1. Database elements})
should be Times 11-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left, with
one blank line before, and one after. If you require a third-order heading
(we discourage it), use 10-point Times, boldface, initially capitalized,
flush left, preceded by one blank line, followed by a period and your text
on the same line.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Footnotes}

Please use footnotes sparingly% \footnote {% Or, better still, try to
	avoid footnotes altogether.  To help your readers, avoid using footnotes
	altogether and include necessary peripheral observations in the text
	(within parentheses, if you prefer, as in this sentence). and place them
	at the bottom of the column on the page on which they are referenced.
	Use Times 8-point type, single-spaced.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{References}

List and number all bibliographical references in 9-point Times,
single-spaced, at the end of your paper. When referenced in the text,
enclose the citation number in square brackets, for example~\cite{ex1}.
Where appropriate, include the name(s) of editors of referenced books.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Illustrations, graphs, and photographs}

All graphics should be centered. Your artwork must be in place in the
article (preferably printed as part of the text rather than pasted up).
If you are using photographs and are able to have halftones made at a
print shop, use a 100- or 110-line screen. If you must use plain photos,
they must be pasted onto your manuscript. Use rubber cement to affix the
images in place. Black and white, clear, glossy-finish photos are
preferable to color. Supply the best quality photographs and illustrations
possible. Penciled lines and very fine lines do not reproduce well.
Remember, the quality of the book cannot be better than the originals
provided. Do NOT use tape on your pages!

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Color}

The use of color on interior pages (that is, pages other than the cover)
is prohibitively expensive. We publish interior pages in color only when
it is specifically requested and budgeted for by the conference
organizers. DO NOT SUBMIT COLOR IMAGES IN YOUR PAPERS UNLESS SPECIFICALLY
INSTRUCTED TO DO SO.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Symbols}

If your word processor or typewriter cannot produce Greek letters,
mathematical symbols, or other graphical elements, please use
pressure-sensitive (self-adhesive) rub-on symbols or letters (available in
most stationery stores, art stores, or graphics shops).

%------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
\SubSection{Copyright forms}

You must include your signed IEEE copyright release form when you submit
your finished paper. We MUST have this form before your paper can be
published in the proceedings.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Conclusions}
