\Section{Introduction}

	Data streaming distributed system architectures are used 
throughout both research and production environments. On one
hand, for research they provide a high degree of flexibility to 
quickly implement and test new algorithms. On the other
hand, for production they need to provide scalability (small effort 
of adding servers to increase performance) and high availability 
without the need for human intervention. Our goal was to implement
a simplified fault-tolerant real-time distributed stream processing 
system that has strong guarantees on the correctness of 
it's distributed computations (semantics) and the predictability of performance 
in case of failures (fault-tolerance).

	We implemented an architecture based on tuple processing. Tuples 
are a data structure comprised of an arbitrary number of ordered fields 
(For simplicity all mentions of tuples will refer to tuples solely comprised
 of Strings) and a unique ID. Our tuple streaming system is comprised of a 
 network of operators. Tuples are streamed throughout the 
network from a starting operator that might read them from
a file to an ending operator that typically outputs to a file or 
produces a result. In this system a distributed computation 
can be seen as an acyclic graph, vertexes correspond to operators 
and links to data input and output. Each of these operators transforms 
the tuples they receive as input and may output them in a processed 
form. This processing varies accordingly to the type of Operator.
In our system we only support a narrow list of different operators
responsible for simple operations such as filtering, counting and
duplicating tuples among others. We also allow the loading of custom 
dll's to support the inclusion of operators tailored for specific cases.

	Since this is a distributed system, operators may execute on 
different machines. Furthermore operators might be divided into
several replicas. All replicas of a certain operator perform the same 
processing operations, however they might also be deployed in different 
machines. These replicas distribute operator load and are the 
core of the system's fault tolerance capabilities. 
	Finally, the fault model we assumed when designing the system implies
that only one replica will crash concurrently, as such, some of our 
solutions might not be adequate for systems where other types of
catastrophic faults might occur.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\Section{Solutions}

	How to create a system with scaling performance, guaranteed results 
and highly automatized fault tolerance is not a new problem. Before we
arrived at our final solution we tested and discussed other solutions
for fault tolerance and semantics. Some of these solutions and their main 
advantages and disadvantages are briefly discussed ahead.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Waiting for an ACK}

	One naive approach that is often mentioned when discussing semantics and 
result guarantees is waiting for some sort of confirmation from the 
following replica confirming that the tuple has been successfully delivered
to it's destination. This way there is guarantee that tuples are delivered 
and processed correctly. 

	Although it is correct to say that this provides guarantees that are uncommon
in distributed systems, this approach is fundamentally incorrect. Implementing
this into a data streaming distributed system would transform it into a 
synchronous system. This would completely annihilate(??) the purpose of a distributed
data streaming architecture. The first operator in a network would have to
wait until the last operator to finish for it to know that the delivery and processing 
were executed correctly and that it could continue processing tuples. 

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Mirroring data throughout the network}

	 Another naive approach to semantics and fault tolerance is mirroring data  
throughout the network. In this case it could be applied by mirroring and saving 
received tuples on all replicas. By having all information that goes through an
operator, replicas can guarantee that no information is lost when a fault occurs.
Contrarily to the previous solution, this approach doesn't slow the processing 
of tuples by the operators, but it creates other problems. 

	Sending every received tuple to every other replica imposes a heavy communication
load on the network infrastructure and creates the need for big storage 
capabilities on machines running the replicas. Despite the fact that this solution
works, it is sub-optimal as keeping a copy of the tuple on every replica is unnecessary.
	
%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\Section{Overview}

	As we saw before, other solutions to this problem have several crippling 
disadvantages. Our analysis of other approaches allowed us to avoid some of the 
common pitfalls and get insight into factors like communication load imposed on 
the network infrastructure. Taking this into account we designed solutions we believe 
could be applied to real world scenarios. We tried to create an abstraction between 
our replica fault tolerance and our semantics algorithms, guaranteeing that one does 
not depend on the other, as such we feel that they should be seen as separate 
entities.  (????????? vai contra o que o jorge diz????????)

	Our Fault Tolerance algorithm can be divided into three separate phases: Fault
detection, replacement and reinstating. Fault detection is handled solely by 
the replicas of a single operator. Replicas are organized into a ring architecture
and are responsible for detecting faults on replicas placed next to them in this
ring. Replica replacement is also handled by the replicas, when a replica fails, 
the replica that was responsible for it's state monitoring completely takes 
over the failed replica's responsibilities. It signals the previous and following 
operators to ensure they no longer send data to the failed replica. 
Reinstating a replica is a simple process that returns the network to it's original 
configuration. It is the opposite of the replica replacement and must again signal
neighboring operators to communicate network topology changes.

	Our semantics algorithm has three different behaviors for the three types 
of semantics: at-most-once, at-least-once, exactly-once. The at-most-once
doesn't require any special behavior as in this case the system always has the same 
behavior irrespective of failures. At-least-once and exactly-once algorithms share 
a lot of their behavior and data structures. These algorithms utilize a shared tuple table
on replicas to keep track of the status of all tuples received by the operator, 
where they were received from and where are supposed to be sent to. This
table only stores the ID and status of tuples, reducing communication load in the
network. Furthermore only the replicas on the path of a certain tuple store that tuple 
and when needed, due to the tuple table, other replicas know where it is. Finally we also
implemented a confirmation system where replicas can relay a signal to previous replicas
confirming the processing of the tuple, this way tuples are only stored temporarily. 
The main difference between exactly-once and at-least-once is that the former 
must guarantee that tuples are never processed twice. We utilize the tuple table
to enforce that guarantee. Every time a tuple is received it is checked against the 
table, if it had already been processed it is not accepted. 

	Further and more in-depth explanation of these algorithms follows in the next chapters.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\Section{Fault-Tolerance}

To make sure that the system is always kept in a working state, it needs
to be able to recover from faults within the fault model and recover to a
working network configuration. Our fault tolerance algorithm provides the
ability to tolerate a downed replica of any operator, as well as proceed
to it's recuperation. The algorithm we used is possible due to the use of
a simple, yet resourceful abstraction mechanism, which the semantics
algorithm will also greatly benefit from aswell. Each of the replica
mantains three sets of of dictionaries on which a replica is associated to
a number (initally the replica number), except on the first and last
operator's replicas. This is because each of the dictionaries holds the
correspondence between a replica and the dictionary holder's view of it.
One dictionary abstracts all of the colleague replicas of the holder
(replicas of the same operator as itself), another distinct dictionary
abstracts the replicas of the above operator, and again for the one below.
So every replica of every operator has the ability to establish a
connection with what they think is every replica above and below them, as
well as their colleagues.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Fault Detection}

\begin{figure}[h] \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{fault_detection}
	\caption{How colleague replicas ping each other} \end{figure}

Going into more detail on how a downed replica can be detected.  Colleague
replicas among themselves have the illusion of being in a ring like
topology. Each replica periodically pings the following colleague like
ilustrated in Figure. 1. A replica can efficiently know what replica it
preceeds. It knows it's own replica index (i) therefore it knows the index
of the replica it has to ping: ping(i), by applying the following rule:
\[ping(i) = (i + 1)\ \%\ number\ of\ replicas\] If the pinged replica is
detected to be down, then the replica can just calculate the following
replica's index using the very same rule, and contact it, asking for it to
take over the downed replica's spot. 

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Take Over Procedure}

The replica taking over goes through the 3 sets of replica holding
abstractions aforementioned.  Firstly it iterates over the the replica
holding abstractions corresponding to the operator above it, and for each
one, it substitues the place of the replica detected as downed with a
representation of itself. It literally takes over it's spot, so every
command that would be aimed at the downed replica, is routed to the one
that took over it's functions.  It then repeats the process for it's
colleague replicas and the ones of the operator below it. 

\begin{figure}[h] \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{take_over}
	\caption{Take over prodecure illustrated} \end{figure}

There is however a small detail that caused a somewhat meaningful problem.
In the case of an operator having only two replicas, and one of them going
down, the only remaining replica would substitute the representation of
it's colleague with itself, and then effectively start pinging itself.
This caused not only some performance issues besides other problems.  In
order to fix this efficiently we had to break a small layer of abstraction
and add another structure to the replicas, a list containing the indexes
of the replicas it has taken over. This allows a replica to know whether
it would be attempting to connect to itself or not.

After a replica has fully taken over for another one, all other replicas
have the illusion of the topology state remaining the same. This is
because every method that implies connecting to another replica, obtains
the connection through the abstraction layer previously described, so
every work load is seamlessly diverted to the new replica.  Only replicas
within the same operator can detect downed replicas. If any other remoting
method fails due to the target replica being down, it enters an active
wait untill another replica takes over and the method is succesfully
carried out. We chose this implementation over the option of any remoting
task possibly triggering a take over, due to the possibility of the
retrying of the faulting method being faster than the take over process.
Fixing this issue would over complicate things, and the simpler
implementation as we have now revealed it self as the faster one.
%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Reinstate Procedure}

The reinstating protocol is simply put, the reverse of the take over
process. Once a replica is brought back it goes through the same process
of accessing previous, colleague and following operator's replica
abstraction holding structures in that respective order, and inserting a
representation of itself in it's rightful spot.  After this, all remote
methods are once again routed correctly to the reinstated replica.  The
replica that had taken over for it also has it's index list updated,
meaning that the index of the reinstated replica is removed from that
list.
%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\Section{Semantics}

One of the biggest concerns in distributed tuple processing is being able
to a guarantee certain semantics associated with the processing of a tuple
in the presence of system failures, and inevitably the way it needs to
reconfigure in order to continue functioning properly. This issue is
inevitably linked to the way that the system does fault tolerance. The
algorithm used for any semantic guarantee is very simillar, using the same
data structures and most of the same procedures. We will first explain the
general idea behind the algorithm, then used data structures and the
algorithm and finally how it used to assure that a tuple is processed at
most once, at least once and exactly once.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Explanation}


If the system must process a certain tuple at least once then there must a
guarantee that in any kind of a node failure the tuples that weren't
successfuly sent to a node in failure are sent either to another node or
to the the original node if it recovers. There are however other scenarios
in which a node can fail, For example after receiving a tuple but before
sending it to the next operator. Keeping in mind that the system must
obviously be ashynchronous in this confirmation, then the previous node
can't easily know it has to resend the tuple, and when it doesn't, or how
long it needs to keep the tuple.  In this approach the tuples would need
to be kept in every operator at least until the tuple was processed by
every node, presenting scalability issues. That's why we opted to use an
algorithm based in keeping the information of the tuples being processed
and by which replica, as well as which replica originally contains the
tuple.  That way all the tuples that weren't sent can be processed and
sent again if a new node takes over a dead node without the need to
replica tuples by all nodes of an operator.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Data Structures}


To understand how the algorithm works we must first explain the used data
structures: A tuple is identified by it's Tuple Id structure which
represents a stream of a tuple along the processing chain. In each
specific tuple there is an unique id that is usualy kept along all
operators, unless there must an output of several tuples from the same
one, efectively diverging the tuple stream.  The remaining information
kept in the Tuple Id refers to the operator and replica it came from. 

In each node there is a delivery table (a simple Hash-based Map that
stores each tuple by its unique id) and that keeps every tuple received in
a replica until it can be disposed.  

There is also a shared tuple table in each node that stores Tuple Records
associated to a tuple id (in a simillar Hash Map). A tuple record is a
small representation of a tuple containing its Tuple Id, as well as the
replica emiting the tuple record. This way the tuple record contains only
the necessary information for a node to re-process a tuple that wasn't
properly processed due to failure. For information storing purposes the
tuple records have a state (pending or purged) that is used to store tuple
records of the tuples processed by a replica in a purged state instead of
deleting them in order to properly know what tuples have already been
processed by that replica.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Algorithm}

\begin{figure}[h] \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{semantics}
	\caption{Ordered steps taken when a node processes a tuple} \end{figure}

The ordered steps represented in figure 1 show most of the necessary
procedures executed every time a tuple is received, to keep the data
structures synchronized in order to allow a proper recovery when a node
fails. When a node receives a tuple (1) the first thing it must do is
insert it into it's delivery table (2) and it's shared tuple record table
(3). The node then synchronizes every table with other replicas shared
tables (4) and finnaly processes the tuple, sending it afterwards (5).
After the tuple is sent and confirmation is received (6) the node will
first issue the deletion of the tuple record of every other shared table
and purge its own shared table of the same tuple (7). Finally it will warn
the replica which the tuple originated from that it can finally delete it
from its delivery table (8) since it was already received by the forward
node. This information is used whenever a node takes over another failling
node. It scans its shared table looking for tuple records of the dead node
and for each record it finds, it requests the tuple to the replica that
the tuple originated from. Finally that tuple is processed and sent to the
following node, by the same procedures explained before, as if a new tuple
was received. 

Note that this approach only ensures the semantics of the delivery in case
of a single horizontal failure (when two sequential replicas on the path
of processing a tuple fail). It could also support more failures if
necessary by extending the number of nodes where a tuple is kept before it
is delivered.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Differences for each guarantee}



%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\subsubsection{At-Most-Once}

\forceindent To assure that a tuple is processed at most once, a system
must only send any tuple once, indepent of failure. Since a configuration
for this system is dependent on being an acyclic graph, the only guarantee
we need to provide is that there isn't any kind of mechanism to resend
tuples in case of a takeover of a node that crashed by another node.  As
such the implementation of this strategy relies on not sharing any kind of
information about tuples already processed, which is achieved by not
executing any kind of the procedures explained before related to the
applied algorithm (that isn't really applied in this case of semantics).
This way, a certain tuple from an input is only sent once in the forward
direction of the distributed network, and in case of a node failing all
the tuples that it had processed but not sent yet won't be processed at
all. The same applies to a replica that sends a tuple to the next replica,
which in case of not getting a response, will just drop the tuple.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\subsubsection{At-Least-Once}

\forceindent The algorithm previously basicaly accomplishes at least once
delivery by itself, without the need of any changes. 

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\subsubsection{Exactly-Once}

\forceindent Finally to guarantee that tuples are delivered only exactly
once, and taking the algorithm descbibed as a starting point, there is the
need to guarantee that a tuple is never processed twice on the same
operator. The first thing to remember is that each tuple has a unique Id
that identifies it's path along the processing chain. Based on that, each
received tuple on a node is checked by it's id to guarantee that it has
never been processed, by comparing it's unique id to every tuple record
stored in the shared tuple record table (hence the possible states for a
certain tuple).  The tuple is accepted with success in case it was never
inserted in the table, assuring the replica that the tuple was never
processed and sent to next operator before, which together with the
guarantees provided by the algorithm assure exactly once delivery of
tuples.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\Section{Evaluation}

In order to proper understand the effectiveness of the developed solution
it is necessary to understand the performance implications of the used
algorithm and how it compares with other possible solutions. Firstly we
will analyze the used solution from a theoretical standpoint and compare
it with the previously mentioned naive solution. Then we will test a few
measures and compare them to the theoretical results in order to provide
some confirmation.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Analysis}

To simplify the process of creating a model that fits the developed system
we will consider a few assumptions that hopefully won't distort the
obtained results by much: \begin{itemize} \item The considered system is
			only comprised of simple operators where one tuple can only
		originate another tuple, without stream divergences; \item The system
			can be simplified by some measures where $R$ is the average
			replication factor of each operator, $O$ is the number of operators
		and $T$ is the average size of a tuple being sent; \item Tuple Records
			have have a constant size of 64 bits for the unique id plus 32 bits
			to identify the operator and replica and 1 bit for the state.  This
			value is represented by $TR \approx 128\ bits$.  \end{itemize} In
	this case the system consists of an acyclic (forward) graph where we can
	attribute a weight to each transition depending on what measure we're
	analyzing.

Let's start by considering the amount of data transfered per tuple sent:
For each tuple received by a replica it sends a tuple record to every
other replica, so $(R-1)\times TR$. There is also a purge message that
contains only a unique id, which we will aproximate to the Tuple Record
(TR) size. Similarly the confirmation to the previous contains the id. All
things considered the total amount of data for each tuple received per
replica for all the operators is 

%\[ (R - 1 + 1 + 1) \times TR \times O \Rightarrow O(R \times TR \times O)
%\\ TR\ is\ constant\ \Rightarrow O(R \times O) \]

\begin{eqnarray*} &(R - 1 + 1 + 1) \times TR \times O \Rightarrow O(R
	\times TR \times O) \\ &TR\ is\ constant\ \Rightarrow O(R \times O)
\end{eqnarray*}

Comparatively a naive solution that receives a tuple on a replica and
replicates it through all the replicas (removing the necessity for forward
and backwards confirmation) would require 

\[ (R-1)\times T \times O \Rightarrow O(R \times T \times O)\]

The difference of both approaches being that our proposed solution scales
with the size of a tuple record, $TR$ which is a constant value, while the
naive approach will scale with the tuple size as well $T$. For increasing
tuple sizes the difference in data that needs to be exchanged between
replicas for each tuple is noticeably smaller as we expect to confirm in
the pratical results. In this sense, we can start to understand the
performance advantages presented by our solution when $T \gg TR$.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Qualitative}

Qualitative evaluation

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\Section{Discussion}

Prior to analyzing the used algorithms, we have to acknowledge that the
solutions aren't perfect but are a step forward from the naive approaches
that might be picked in this situation. Most of the differences are
actually unintelligible when processing small datasets, in which each
tuple is small. 

For example in this case there is an advantage of replicating tuples in
each node after receiving from the operator, considering their sizes might
be even smaller than the tuple records and there are less steps involved
in the algorithm. But on the other hand, if we try to scale the tuple size
even a litle bit, then the tuple-replicating approach would scale much
worse, resulting in huge amounts of exchanged data between replicas of the
same operator before they can even process the tuples. On the other hand,
replicating only tuple records scales in a constant way with tuple size
(doesn't increase).  So as analyzed from this feature, one thing to note
is that there is no perfect solution that applies to every kind of system
in a scallable and eficient way.  A much better compromise is to develop
the system according to whatever are its needs, and if possible without
forgetting the scalability to a real word scenario of applying the
developed solution.

As far as fault detection goes, we think that other topologies can be
adopted besides our ring-like one. It would really come down to the real
life application of the system. A possibly good heuristic could be how far
replicas are from each other, so the whole operator ping cycle (all
replicas get pinged) is made as fast as possible. With different
topologies different methods of picking what replica takes over are
necessary. If the topology is a tree-like, then choosing a candidate
becomes much harder. Some other things can be taken into account when
picking a take over candidate, for example, work load metrics can be
shared with each "are you alive" in order to pick which replica would take
the extra load better. Another even more complex possible solution is to
have more than one replica assigned to taking over the downed replica's
work load. Once again it all depends on the real life application scenario
Regarding the take-over and reinstating methods, we support the opinion
that there aren't any meaningful variations of our adopted solution that
can be done taking into account our network topology.
